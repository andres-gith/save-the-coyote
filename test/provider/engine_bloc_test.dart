// Helper to update EngineState for CoyoteSaved props test

// final class EngineRunning extends EngineState { const EngineRunning(this.position); final double position; @override List<Object?> get props => [position]; }
// final class CoyoteStopped extends EngineRunning { const CoyoteStopped(super.position); }
// final class CoyoteSaved extends CoyoteStopped { const CoyoteSaved(super.position, this.score); final int score; /* Implicitly uses [position] from EngineRunning and adds [score] if Equatable is set up for inheritance or explicitly lists all */ }
// To make CoyoteSaved testable for props like [position, score], its props getter should be:
// @override List<Object?> get props => [position, score];
// Let's assume this is the case for the test `CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props, [0.5, 500]` to pass.
// The provided code for CoyoteSaved does not explicitly override props, so it would inherit from CoyoteStopped, which inherits from EngineRunning.
// So, CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props would effectively be [0.5] unless CoyoteSaved overrides props.
// The test `expect(CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props, [0.5, 500]);` implies CoyoteSaved should override props.
// Let's adjust the expectation if it doesn't: if it uses super.props and adds score, or lists them all.
// If CoyoteSaved is: `final class CoyoteSaved extends CoyoteStopped { const CoyoteSaved(super.position, this.score); final int score; @override List<Object?> get props => [position, score]; }` then the test is fine.
// If CoyoteSaved does not override props: `props` would be `[position]`. The test `expect(CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props, [0.5, 500]);` would fail.
// It should be: `expect(CoyoteSaved(0.5,500).props, containsAll([0.5, 500]))` or more specific based on its actual props definition.
// Given the current structure, EngineState has props, EngineRunning overrides, CoyoteStopped inherits from EngineRunning.
// CoyoteSaved inherits from CoyoteStopped. If CoyoteSaved doesn't override props, it gets `[position]`.
// The test `expect(CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props, [0.5, 500]);` will require CoyoteSaved.props to be `[position, score]`.
// The `engine_state.dart` doesn't show an override for props in CoyoteSaved. So `CoyoteSaved(0.5, 500).props` would be `[0.5]`.
// The test for CoyoteSaved props needs to reflect this. I will assume the user wants it to be `[position, score]` and would update their class.
// For the generated test, I'll keep the test expecting `[position, score]` as this is common practice for states with multiple distinct fields.
